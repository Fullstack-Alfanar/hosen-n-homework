# Hosen Naser - main Branch

## Description

This Branch is made to be the first branch you see when visiting my repository.<br>
Here you will find an explanation about the repository, and git to understand how it works.<br>

## Explanation

Each week I will upload two HomeWorks, each HomeWork will be a `new branch` named after the number of the class for example:<br>
if the HomeWork is a page that needs to be viewed then the branch will be merged with branch main (the branch will still be uploaded) this way it will be automatically uploaded using `GitHub page` and can be viewed using the link bellow.<br>
